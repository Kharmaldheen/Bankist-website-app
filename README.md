# About The Bankist Website

The bankist website is a bank website built with HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. I built this website to practise my javascript files. the website has features including a modal window, smooth scrolling and page navigation, menu fade animation and stiky navigation, a slider, lazy loading images, a tab component, and Revealing sections. I was able to practise a lot of my javascript skills with this website and I learned a lot too.

Happy Checking !!!
